# 100-days-ML
Hi,

This is my personal repository which save my roadmap of machine learning.
It would include 100 file named from day 1 to day 100 in which I will do another project everyday with the hard level gradually increase.
Through this 100-day course, I do hope that my skills will be sharpen and I will be able to create something that really cool during that time.
It would be a pleasure to me if you can find something that useful in my codes.

Best regards,
